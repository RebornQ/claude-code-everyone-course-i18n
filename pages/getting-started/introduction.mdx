## 0.0: Intro to Claude Code

## What is Claude Code?

Claude Code is an AI assistant that works directly on your computer:

- **Not just for coding** - It's a general-purpose assistant backed by Claude (Opus 4.5)
- **Reads files, analyzes data, creates documents, runs commands**
- **Lives in the terminal** - but you just have conversations
- **The only command you need to know:** `claude`

## Who This Course Is For

- **Non-technical people** who want to use AI effectively
- **No coding experience required**
- **No terminal experience required**
- Just curiosity and a willingness to try something new

## Course Structure

| Module | Focus | Time |
|--------|-------|------|
| **Module 1: Fundamentals** | File operations, agents, memory | ~3 hours |
| **Module 2: Vibe Coding** | Build a real web app (Coming Soon) | ~2-3 hours |
| **Future Modules** | MCP integrations, browser automation | TBD |

## Requirements

- Claude Pro or Max subscription ($20/month at [claude.ai](https://claude.ai))
- Mac, Windows, or Linux computer
- ~3 hours for Module 1

## Claude Code vs ChatGPT

| Feature | ChatGPT | Claude Code |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **File access** | None | Read/write any file |
| **Memory** | Disappears after session | Persistent (CLAUDE.md) |
| **Execution** | Suggests what to do | Actually does it |
| **Multi-file** | One at a time | Dozens simultaneously |
| **Agents** | Single instance | Parallel processing |

**The difference:** Claude Code doesn't just give advice - it does the work with you.

## The Mindset Shift

> From "I need to learn commands" to "I need this outcome"

- You're learning to **orchestrate**, not to code
- Describe what you want, Claude figures out how
- The terminal is just where you have conversations
