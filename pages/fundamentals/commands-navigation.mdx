## Custom Slash Commands

- They're files in `.claude/commands/`
- Shortcuts for things you do repeatedly
- You can create your own (just ask Claude to make one)
- **Important:** Restart Claude Code after adding new commands

## Escape to Interrupt

Press **Escape** to stop Claude mid-response.
- Useful when you see Claude going the wrong direction
- You're always in control

## Rewind Feature (Esc×2)

Press **Escape twice** to see rewind options:
- Reset conversation only (keep files Claude created)
- Reset conversation AND undo file changes

Like time travel for AI work - great for experimenting.

## Think Keywords

| Keyword | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `think` | Normal thinking |
| `think harder` | Deeper analysis |
| `ultrathink` | Maximum thinking power (rainbow indicator!) |

Use for complex analysis and strategic decisions.

> **Warning:** Uses more of your usage quota.

## The Three Input Modes

Cycle with **Shift+Tab**:

| Mode | Behavior | Best For |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Edit** (default) | Claude asks permission before changes | Safe, learning |
| **Auto-accept** | Claude just does it | Faster, trusted workflows |
| **Plan** | Claude creates plan first, you review, then it executes | Complex multi-step tasks |

## The Power Mode

```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

Launches Claude with NO permission prompts. Maximum speed - Claude just does everything.

Called "dangerously" for a reason - use when you trust the workflow.

## Keyboard Shortcuts Summary

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Escape` | Interrupt Claude |
| `Escape × 2` | Rewind options |
| `Shift+Tab` | Cycle input modes |
| `Ctrl+`` | Open terminal in editor |
| `Ctrl+V` | Paste images (not Cmd+V on Mac!) |
