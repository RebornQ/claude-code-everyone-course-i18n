## Agents vs Sub-agents

| Aspect | Agents (1.5) | Sub-agents (1.6) |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| **Lifespan** | Temporary - spin up, process, gone | Permanent - always available |
| **Purpose** | Volume, batch processing | Wisdom, perspectives, feedback |
| **Analogy** | "10 interns processing files" | "Advisory board reviewing strategy" |

## The Advisory Team Concept

Like building your own board of advisors:
- Each has a different perspective
- Call on them for feedback from different angles
- Update and improve them over time

## How Sub-agents Work

Sub-agents are defined in `.claude/agents/` folder.

Each file has:
- **YAML frontmatter** (name, description)
- **System prompt** (personality and perspective)

They're just text files - you can view and edit them directly.

## Sub-agent File Structure

```yaml
---
name: Agent Name
description: One-line description
---

# System prompt

You are... [personality and perspective]
```

## Using Sub-agents

Reference them by name in your prompts:

```
Have the Skeptic review this proposal
```

```
Get feedback from all three sub-agents on this plan
```

They respond in character with their perspective.

## Creating Your Own Sub-agents

Use the `/agents` command:
1. Choose **Project** (this project only) or **Personal** (all projects)
2. Claude helps you create the agent

### Ideas for Useful Sub-agents

| Sub-agent | Perspective |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Skeptical Investor** | Pressure-tests ideas and ROI |
| **Confused Beginner** | Checks if instructions are clear |
| **Legal Reviewer** | Spots risks and compliance issues |
| **Busy Executive** | Wants bottom line, no fluff |

## When to Use Sub-agents

- Need thoughtful feedback from different viewpoints
- Stress-testing proposals or plans
- Getting diverse perspectives on a document
- Simulating stakeholder reactions
- Review from specific personas

## Advisory Team Examples

| Scenario | Sub-agents |
|----------|------------|
| **Resume review** | Recruiter + Hiring Manager + Career Coach |
| **Business idea** | Skeptical Investor + Target Customer + Realist |
| **Presentation** | Busy Exec + Detail-Oriented Analyst + Skeptic |
| **Writing** | Editor + Target Reader + Harsh Critic |
| **Big decision** | Risk-Averse + Opportunity-Focused + Practical |
