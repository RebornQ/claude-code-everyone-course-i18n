## 1.2: File Exploration & Visual Workspace

- **Time to Complete:** 15 minutes

> **Interactive lesson:** Run `/start-1-2` in Claude Code

## The Dual-Pane Workflow

**Problem:** Terminal is great for talking to Claude, but you can't see your files.

**Solution:** Use a code editor alongside Claude Code.

| Pane | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Left side** | File explorer (see everything) |
| **Bottom** | Claude Code terminal (work with everything) |

## Setting Up Cursor (or VS Code)

[Cursor](https://cursor.com) is a free code editor that works perfectly alongside Claude Code:

- Shows your files visually while you work with Claude
- Has its own AI features (you don't need them - Claude Code is better)
- VS Code works too if you prefer it

### Installation

1. Download from [cursor.com](https://cursor.com)
2. Run the installer
3. Open Cursor

## Running Claude Code Inside Your Editor

1. **Open terminal in Cursor:** `Ctrl+`` (backtick key, above Tab)
   - Or: View → Terminal
2. **Navigate to your folder:** `cd ~/Documents/your-folder`
3. **Type `claude` and press Enter**

Now you have files visible on the left, Claude in the terminal below.

## Exploring Unfamiliar File Structures

Once Claude Code is running, you can ask:

```
Show me the file structure
```

```
Summarize the contents of the docs/ folder
```

```
What files are in this project?
```

Claude can map out any folder of documents for you.

## Markdown Files

- `.md` extension = Markdown format
- Common standard for documents - LLMs love it
- **Preview mode:** `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+V` shows formatted view
- **Raw mode:** Shows the markup

## Real-World Applications

- **Inherit a project from a coworker** - Claude maps it out
- **Client sends messy brand assets** - get oriented in minutes
- **Downloads folder chaos** - Claude helps clean up
- **Starting a new job** - understand the team's shared drive
- **Any unfamiliar file structure**
