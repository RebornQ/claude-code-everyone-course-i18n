## 1.5: Agents

- **Time to Complete:** 20 minutes

> **Interactive lesson:** Run `/start-1-5` in Claude Code

## What Are Agents?

**Independent instances of Claude running in parallel.**

Like cloning yourself to work on multiple tasks simultaneously. Each agent works on its own task, results get combined at the end.

## Sequential vs Parallel

| Approach | Time for 10 Tasks |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Sequential** (without agents) | Task 1 → Task 2 → ... → Task 10 = **50 minutes** |
| **Parallel** (with agents) | All 10 simultaneously = **5 minutes** |

## When to Use Agents

**Good for:**
- Many similar files to process (10 meeting notes, 20 interviews)
- Parallel research (5 competitors, 3 markets)
- Multi-source analysis (interviews + surveys + tickets)
- Batch document generation (20 user stories from one PRD)
- Time-sensitive work (need results in hours, not days)

**Not good for:**
- Single tasks (just use regular Claude)
- Sequential work (tasks depend on each other)
- Quick tasks (takes seconds anyway)
- Context-dependent work (needs to build on previous)

## How to Prompt for Agents

| Style | Example |
|-------|---------|
| **Explicit** | "Create 10 agents to process these files" |
| **Implicit** | "Work in parallel to analyze these competitors" |
| **Specialized** | "Launch 3 agents: one for interviews, one for surveys, one for tickets" |
| **Let Claude decide** | "Process all files in /meetings/" |

## Agent Orchestration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Fan Out
Same task on many files.

```
Process all 15 files with 15 agents, extract action items, combine into single list
```

### Pattern 2: Specialized Roles
Different analysis on different sources.

```
Agent 1 analyzes interviews, Agent 2 processes survey data, Agent 3 reviews tickets
```

### Pattern 3: Parallel Research
Research multiple entities independently.

```
Research these 5 competitors in parallel, create comparison matrix
```

### Pattern 4: Batch Generation
Create multiple similar documents.

```
Generate 20 user stories from this PRD using agents
```

### Pattern 5: Validation Pipeline
Review multiple documents for quality.

```
Review all documents in /docs/ against the quality checklist
```

## The Synthesis Step

**ALWAYS include synthesis in your prompt:**

```
After all agents complete, synthesize results into @summary.md
```

Raw agent outputs need combining - synthesis is where patterns emerge.

## Agent Capabilities & Limits

| Each agent HAS | Each agent does NOT have |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| Full file system access | Communication with other agents |
| All Claude's capabilities | Shared state |
| Independent context | Knowledge of other agents' results (until synthesis) |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Agents not working in parallel | Say explicitly "work simultaneously" |
| Results inconsistent | Provide clear output template |
| Too many agents | Specify exact count |
| No synthesis | Always end with "synthesize into..." |

## Real-World Applications

- **Job postings** - analyze 10 roles at once
- **Vendor evaluation** - research 5 vendors in parallel
- **Article summaries** - process 20 saved articles
- **Apartment hunting** - analyze 8 listings simultaneously
- **Trip planning** - flights, hotels, activities, restaurants all at once
