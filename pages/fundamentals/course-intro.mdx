## 1.1: Course Introduction

## How This Course Works

- **Learning by doing** - not watching videos
- **Claude teaches you directly** in the terminal
- **Reference guides** (what you're reading) provide deeper context
- Every lesson has a reference page on ccforeveryone.com

### Interactive Lessons

Each lesson starts with a slash command:
- `/start-1-1`, `/start-1-2`, etc.

Claude guides you step-by-step through hands-on exercises. You actually do the work, not just read about it.

### Reference Guides

These pages provide:
- Deeper explanations of concepts
- Quick reference for commands and patterns
- Additional resources and links
- Troubleshooting help
