## 1.7: Project Memory (CLAUDE.md)

- **Time to Complete:** 15 minutes

> **Interactive lesson:** Run `/start-1-7` in Claude Code

## Additional Resources

- [Official Docs: Memory](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/memory) - Anthropic documentation

## The Re-Explanation Problem

Every new ChatGPT conversation starts from zero. You have to re-explain:
- Project context
- Your preferences
- Key terminology

This wastes time and breaks flow.

## What is CLAUDE.md?

A special file Claude reads automatically every session:
- **Lives at the root** of your project folder
- **Persistent memory** that survives sessions
- **Write it once**, Claude knows it forever

## The Constitution Metaphor

| Aspect | CLAUDE.md (Constitution) | Your Prompts (Legislation) |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Priority** | Higher authority | Day-to-day decisions |
| **Permanence** | Stays forever | Temporary per request |
| **Conflicts** | CLAUDE.md wins | Must comply with CLAUDE.md |

CLAUDE.md sets the foundation, prompts handle specifics.

## What to Put in CLAUDE.md

- Project overview and goals
- Key metrics and targets
- Stakeholder information
- Brand voice and constraints
- User personas
- Terminology rules (ALWAYS use X not Y)
- Writing style preferences
- Immutable rules (things that should ALWAYS or NEVER happen)

## What NOT to Put in CLAUDE.md

- Temporary information (today's meeting notes)
- Frequently changing requirements (this sprint's goal)
- Sensitive information (API keys, private data)

**The test:** Would you want Claude to know this in 6 months?

## CLAUDE.md Structure Template

```markdown
## Project Overview
What it is, who it's for, your role

## User Personas
Key personas with pain points

## Writing Style
Voice, tone, formatting preferences

## Terminology
ALWAYS use X not Y

## Immutable Rules
Things that should always/never happen

## Team Reference
Key people and roles
```

## The # Symbol for Dynamic Rules

Add temporary rules during a session:

```
# always use bullet points in this session
```

Applies only to current conversation. Good for experimenting before adding to CLAUDE.md.

## CLAUDE.md Hierarchy

| Level | Location | Scope |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Global** | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Your preferences everywhere |
| **Project** | `/project-root/CLAUDE.md` | This project's context |
| **Directory** | `/project-root/subfolder/CLAUDE.md` | Specific area |
| **Local** | `/project-root/CLAUDE.local.md` | Personal, gitignored |

More specific wins on conflicts. All levels combine (don't replace).

## Using Hierarchy Effectively

| Level | Example Content |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Global** | "I prefer concise responses, use bullet points" |
| **Project** | Product overview, personas, terminology |
| **Directory** | Specific rules for different areas |
| **Local** | Personal preferences not shared with team |

## Best Practices

### Be Specific, Not Vague
- ❌ Bad: "Users like simple interfaces"
- ✅ Good: "User research showed users abandon features with 3+ required fields"

### Use Imperative Language
- ❌ Bad: "It would be nice if..."
- ✅ Good: "ALWAYS include..."

### Provide Context for Rules
- ❌ Bad: "Use Workspace not Project"
- ✅ Good: "Use Workspace not Project - we differentiate from traditional PM tools"

### Keep It Scannable
- Bullet points
- Short paragraphs
- Bold key terms

### Review Quarterly
Your project evolves - so should CLAUDE.md.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Rules being ignored | Make them explicit with ALWAYS/NEVER |
| CLAUDE.md not loading | Check file name is exactly `CLAUDE.md` |
| Too long | Aim for 50-200 lines, link to detailed docs |

## Real-World Applications

- **Personal "life OS"** - goals, values, how you like to work
- **Client projects** - each client's brand voice and history
- **Writing a book** - characters, plot, style guide
- **Side business** - offerings, pricing, personas
- **Job search** - target roles, companies, your story
