## 1.3: Working with Files

- **Time to Complete:** 25 minutes

> **Interactive lesson:** Run `/start-1-3` in Claude Code

## The @ Symbol

`@` is how you reference files and folders for Claude:

| Syntax | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `@filename.md` | Reference a specific file |
| `@folder/` | Reference an entire folder |
| `@folder/file.md` | Reference a file in a subfolder |

Claude reads what you reference and uses it in the response.

## Pattern 1: Single File → Extract

Point Claude at one messy file, extract structured information.

**Example:**
```
Read @meeting-notes.md and extract action items into a new file
```

**Use cases:** Meeting notes, handoff documents, research papers, interview transcripts

## Pattern 2: Folder → Synthesize

Point Claude at a whole folder, find patterns across all files.

**Example:**
```
Look at @feedback/ and synthesize themes across all files
```

**Use cases:** Customer feedback, support tickets, survey responses, research notes

## Pattern 3: Apply Template

Reference a template file along with content.

**Example:**
```
Create a report from @research.md following format in @templates/report.md
```

**Use cases:** Weekly reports, proposals, status updates, any recurring document type

## Pattern 4: Image → Analyze

Paste images directly into Claude Code.

> **Important:** Use `Ctrl+V` (not `Cmd+V` on Mac!)

**Use cases:** UI screenshots, competitor designs, charts, photos, mockups, flyers

## Pattern 5: Web → Research

Ask Claude to search the web.

**Example:**
```
Search for best practices in loyalty program design
```

Claude finds, reads, and synthesizes information. No more 97 browser tabs.

**Use cases:** Competitive research, best practices, industry trends, current events

## Combining Patterns

The real power is in combination:

```
Read @notes.md, search for best practices, and create a report following @templates/report.md
```

Mix and match based on what you need.

## Best Practices

- **Be specific** about what you want extracted
- **Tell Claude where** to put output files
- **Use templates** for consistent formatting
- **Reference multiple files** when you need synthesis
